# alexa

Project done in hackaton. <br>This hackaton was created by 42 and Amazon, we worked on the amazon's vocal service called Alexa.
We created multiples services for 42 students by linking Alexa to the 42 API.

I worked mainly on the search by project option, so, as a student, you can find a place in school near to others students working on the same projet as you.
